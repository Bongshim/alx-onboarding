Pseudo code for summing two squares 
Input: numbers 
Initialize: variable "nums" to store the received numbers 
            variable "numSqrs" to store the squares of the received numbers
            variable "counter" to keep track of the numbers when calculating the sum of squares 
            variable "sum" to store the sum of the squares
For every number in "nums"
    Get the square of the number and push to the array "numSqrs"
"counter" = 0
"sum" = 0
If "counter"  < length of "numSqrs" array
    "sum" = numSqrs["counter"] + "sum"
    return sum
else 
    return sum
